A few years ago I used an RPI+RPI camera to capture images as part of the TAP-J team’s entry in the Japan Innovation Challenge search and rescue competition. This included capturing the autopilot’s location and embedding it into JPEG images. The code we used is here 38 (I think).

If you’re looking for a more robust solution there are some professional geotaggers on the AP wiki 27 that work with sony cameras.
